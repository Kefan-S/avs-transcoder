This library, ismacryp, implements the ISMA encryption and authentication 
protocol defined in "ISMA 1.0 Encryption and Authentication, Version 1.0"
specification which is published on the ISMA web site, www.isma.tv This
specification is referred to as Ismacryp in the remainder of this README.

Certain portions of the protocol are not implemented. Specifically,
selective encryption which allows for the encryption of selected streaming
packets,  and alternating keys.

The ismacryp lib utilizes a separate library, srtplib, for AES Integer
Counter Mode encryption functions. The srtplib is not included in the
mpeg4ip distribution. However, the ismacryp library implemented here
will still operate correctly in the absence of the srtplib. All new
mp4 atoms and headers in the case of streamed files are included in
an Ismacryp file but the data will not be encrypted. The player will
properly decode and play Ismacryp files or streams that are created
without the encryption functions provided by srtplib.

To build and install mpeg4ip without the separate srtplib, follow
instructions provided elsewhere. 

To build and install mpeg4ip with srtplib, perform the following 
steps.

1. Obtain the srtplib package from <where?>
2. Unpack the srtplib files into some directory. The
   following steps assume the srtplib files are in directory
   /root/srtp
3. Configure srtplib with the generic option. This provides
   some changes to the AES ICM functions to remove srtp-specific
   limitations. Then build the srtplib libraries.
   % configure -enable-generic
   % make

4. Once these steps are complete it is necessary to configure mpeg4ip so
   that the srtplib libraries are included in the build process. Go to 
   the mpeg4ip directory and use this configuration:
   % ./cvs_bootstrap -enable-aesicm=/root/srtp

   The directory specified is the directory where you have installed and
   built the srtplib package.

5. Finally build mpeg4ip.
   % make
   % make install

6. Prior to using Ismacryp functions, it necessary to provide a key file.
   The key file must be named .kms_data and a sample is included in this
   directory. This file must be placed in the home directory of the user
   of the mpeg4ip applications. e.g. If you are root, put the key file in
   /root.
   The key file is only necessary if srtplib is included.

Using Ismacryp functions:

1. To create an Ismacryp mp4 file:
   mp4creator -encrypt <filename>
   A new file named <enc-filename> will be created. 

2. To play an Ismacryp file locally. Use mp4player or gmp4player in
   the usual way.

3. To stream an Ismacryp file it is first necessary to create hint
   tracks. Use mp4creator in the usual way.

Functions provided by ismacryplib are described in ismacryp.h
